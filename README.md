# On The Map

## Description
* "On The Map" is one of Udacity's Swift Nanodegree Projects.
* The app has a tab bar containing a table view and a map view where the students data are displayed as a list and as annotations, respectively.
* Upon tapping a cell, the user is sent to the student's designated website. 
* Upon tapping an annotation, a view is displayed showing some student information, and by tapping it you are set to their website.

## Objectives
* This app was created as a final exercise for the Networking basics lessons of the Nanodegree.

## API
* Data used in the app is fetched from an API provided by Udacity.
* All the information the app displays is mocked, it isn't real data from Udacity's students.

## TODOs
* Refactor. App implementation is outdated and does not reflect my current programming skills.
